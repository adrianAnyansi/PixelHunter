Web-based project for isolating computer font and other color hunting things.


# What is Pixel Hunter?

Pixel Hunter is a program I built who's only job is to isolate certain ranges of colours from images.

This is specifically for computer generated graphics, where colours will either be: 
1. A single unbroken RGB colour
2. Composed ontop or behind another colour, and thus affected by filtering techniques like
alpha composition
ADD
MULTIPLY
etc.

This is mostly a tool for personal use to help parse images for OCR or remove backgrounds.
